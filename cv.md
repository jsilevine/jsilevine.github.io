## Currently

Ph.D Candidate and NSF Fellow in the <a href = "https://levine.princeton.edu/">Levine</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.princeton.edu/pacala/home">Pacala</a> Labs, <a href = "https://eeb.princeton.edu/">Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a> at Princeton University.

## Research interests

I am an ecologist focusing on a wide array of environmental topics including: fire ecology and management, biodiversity maintenance, competition and coexistence, ecophsyiology, and statistical methods. To explore these subjects I develop ecological theory and perform empirical studies and experiments, letting each inform the other in order to seek a more complete understanding of complex ecological systems. To aid in this pursuit, I leverage novel techniques in high-performance computing and statistical methods.

## Misc. Research Projects

`2017-2018`
__[NIMBLE](https://r-nimble.org/)__

Developed a [repository](https://r-nimble.org/nimbleExamples/Ecology_Examples.html) of working examples for the NIMBLE hierarchical modeling environment. To do so, I adapted  models from the popular book [*Applied Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology*](https://www.elsevier.com/books/applied-hierarchical-modeling-in-ecology-analysis-of-distribution-abundance-and-species-richness-in-r-and-bugs/kery/978-0-12-801378-6?countrycode=US&format=print&utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=usashopping&gclid=CjwKCAjwvuGJBhB1EiwACU1AicuAtkzy4id8jfSiviIxL5602Ee75-pkGGT6sj-Do0TcRNWyl7-zoxoCNSYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) by Marc Kery and Andy Royle from the BUGS language to use in NIMBLE. In addition, I compared Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling performance across platforms including NIMBLE (base), NIMBLE (custom), [WinBUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/), and [jags](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/rjags.pdf).
